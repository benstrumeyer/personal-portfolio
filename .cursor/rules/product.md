# Product Vision & Goals

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Personal Portfolio  
**Vision:** Create a personal portfolio in the form of https://www.drawaurora.com/ . This is a zen space background using p5.js with a slow moving landscape at the bottom with various environmental effects like snow, rain, sun moving across the sky in an ellipse. Then on click you can shoot lasers or fireworks or do things based on mouse events and through a settings button at the bottom. I want to create a similar webpage where I can show off a bunch of frontend animating effects. 

## Core Objectives
- **Primary Goal:** Create the canvas and background to show off various effects
- **User Experience:** Open the website, and slowly understand what I can do by doing various actions like clicking, moving the mouse. But I should immediately be wowed and wonder what I can do in this space. It should also be pretty chill at first, and small animations but a lot of them go a long way in presenting breadth. Design should look seamless. I need to think of a theme but we can copy this for now. 
- **Performance:** Fast loading times and responsive design across all devices
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive user experience

## Target Audience
- Potential employers and clients
- Professional network and colleagues
- Industry peers and collaborators

## Success Metrics
- Mobile responsiveness across all screen sizes
- Fast page load times (< 3 seconds)
- Accessible design meeting WCAG standards
- Clean, professional visual presentation

## Brand Guidelines
- **Tone:** Professional yet approachable
- **Style:** Modern, clean, minimalist
- **Colors:** TBD (to be defined during design phase)
- **Typography:** Clear, readable fonts

## Key Features (High Level)
- Home/landing page with background land moving, moon/sun moving across the sky. Toolbar at bottom with various effects. All effects in the vision created.
