# Requirements Document

## Introduction
The background sky feature creates a dynamic, animated sky system for the portfolio's canvas background. This includes sun/moon movement across the sky in elliptical paths, creating day/night cycles and atmospheric effects that enhance the immersive experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Sky Canvas System
**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio, I want to see a dynamic sky with celestial objects moving across it, so that I experience an immersive, living environment that responds to time.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a sky canvas with a sun or moon visible
2. IF the sun is visible THEN the system SHALL move it in an elliptical path across the sky over time
3. WHEN the sun reaches the horizon THEN the system SHALL transition to display the moon
4. IF the moon is visible THEN the system SHALL move it in an elliptical path across the sky over time
5. WHEN the moon reaches the horizon THEN the system SHALL transition to display the sun

### Requirement 2: Day/Night Cycle
**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the sky to transition between day and night, so that the environment feels dynamic and time-aware.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the sun is above the horizon THEN the system SHALL render a day sky with appropriate colors
2. WHEN the moon is above the horizon THEN the system SHALL render a night sky with appropriate colors
3. IF transitioning between day and night THEN the system SHALL smoothly blend sky colors over time
4. WHEN in day mode THEN the system SHALL use warm colors (blues, oranges, yellows)
5. WHEN in night mode THEN the system SHALL use cool colors (deep blues, purples, blacks)

### Requirement 3: Celestial Object Rendering
**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see clearly rendered sun and moon objects, so that the sky feels realistic and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN rendering the sun THEN the system SHALL display a circular object with appropriate brightness
2. WHEN rendering the moon THEN the system SHALL display a circular object with appropriate brightness
3. IF the sun is visible THEN the system SHALL add a glow effect around it
4. WHEN celestial objects move THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent size and appearance
5. IF the object is near the horizon THEN the system SHALL apply atmospheric distortion effects

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization
**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the sky animation to run smoothly, so that the experience feels polished and doesn't impact page performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the sky canvas is active THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps animation
2. IF multiple celestial objects are moving THEN the system SHALL optimize rendering to prevent frame drops
3. WHEN the sky updates THEN the system SHALL use efficient drawing techniques
4. IF the browser is on a low-performance device THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade animation quality
5. WHEN the sky canvas is not visible THEN the system SHALL pause animations to save resources
