# Features Index

This directory contains specifications for all features in the Interactive Personal Portfolio project.

## Feature Development Process

Each feature follows a structured specification process:

1. **Requirements** (`requirements.md`) - User stories and acceptance criteria
2. **Design** (`design.md`) - Technical architecture and implementation details
3. **Tasks** (`tasks.md`) - Step-by-step implementation plan
4. **Overview** (`README.md`) - Feature summary and usage

## Current Features

### Core Canvas Features
- **Background Landscape** - Animated landscape with environmental effects
- **Sky System** - Sun/moon movement across the sky with day/night cycles
- **Weather Effects** - Dynamic snow, rain, and atmospheric conditions
- **Interactive Effects** - Click-triggered lasers and fireworks
- **Particle Systems** - Optimized particle effects with object pooling

### Planned Features
*Additional interactive features can be specified using the AI Planner*

## Creating New Features

To create a new feature specification:

1. **Use AI Planner Mode:** "Let's specify a new feature: [feature description]"
2. **Review Generated Specs:** The planner will create all necessary files
3. **Execute with AI Executor:** "Go and execute the tasks in `docs/features/[feature-name]/tasks.md`"

## Feature Template Structure

```
docs/features/your-feature-name/
├── README.md           # Feature overview and operation
├── requirements.md     # User stories & acceptance criteria
├── design.md          # Technical architecture & components
└── tasks.md           # Step-by-step implementation plan
```

## Integration with AI Workflow

This structure enables seamless integration with:
- **Kiro Spec Mode:** Direct file-based specifications
- **Cursor Custom Modes:** Planner and Executor personas
- **Claude/Gemini:** Master context files with persona definitions

Each feature specification serves as the single source of truth for implementation across different AI tools.
