# Executor Mode - Implementation Guide

## üéØ Mode Overview

**Role:** Meticulous Engineer  
**Primary Function:** Implement approved specifications with high quality  
**Focus:** Code implementation following established patterns and standards  

## üöÄ When to Use Executor Mode

### Ideal Scenarios
- Implementing approved feature specifications
- Following up on incomplete implementations
- Fixing bugs identified in specifications
- Refactoring code according to updated specs
- Completing partially implemented features

### Prerequisites
- Approved specifications in `docs/features/[feature-name]/`
- Clear understanding of existing codebase patterns
- Access to relevant documentation and examples
- Understanding of project architecture and constraints

## üìã Implementation Process

### 1. Specification Review
**Objective:** Understand the complete implementation requirements

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Read and understand `requirements.md`
- [ ] Review technical design in `design.md`
- [ ] Study implementation tasks in `tasks.md`
- [ ] Understand feature overview in `README.md`
- [ ] Review existing codebase patterns and conventions

**Key Information to Gather:**
- Complete feature scope and requirements
- Technical architecture and component design
- Integration points with existing systems
- Performance and accessibility requirements
- Testing and validation approaches

### 2. Codebase Analysis
**Objective:** Understand existing patterns and integration points

**Analysis Areas:**
- Component architecture and patterns
- State management approaches
- Canvas and P5.js integration
- Styling and theming systems
- Testing strategies and coverage
- Import/export patterns

**Key Files to Review:**
- Similar existing components
- Relevant hooks and utilities
- State management slices
- Type definitions
- Test files and patterns

### 3. Sequential Implementation
**Objective:** Execute tasks in order with quality assurance

**Implementation Approach:**
- Execute tasks from `tasks.md` sequentially
- Implement one task at a time with clear progress updates
- Follow established coding standards and patterns
- Add comprehensive tests for all functionality
- Update documentation as implementation progresses

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- **TypeScript:** Strict typing with comprehensive interfaces
- **Performance:** Optimized rendering and memory management
- **Accessibility:** Screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- **Testing:** Unit tests for all components and utilities
- **Documentation:** Clear comments and comprehensive README files

### Component Implementation Pattern
```typescript
// Standard React component implementation
import React from 'react';
import { ComponentProps } from './types';

interface Props {
  // Define props interface with proper typing
}

export const ComponentName: React.FC<Props> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // Component logic with proper hooks and state management
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* JSX content with proper accessibility */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ComponentName;
```

### P5.js Canvas Implementation Pattern
```typescript
// P5.js canvas component implementation
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import p5 from 'p5';
import { P5Types } from '@/types/p5Types';

interface CanvasProps {
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
  onCanvasReady?: (p: p5) => void;
}

export const CanvasComponent: React.FC<CanvasProps> = ({ 
  width = 800, 
  height = 600,
  onCanvasReady 
}) => {
  const canvasRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const p5Instance = useRef<p5 | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (canvasRef.current && !p5Instance.current) {
      const sketch = (p: p5) => {
        p.setup = () => {
          p.createCanvas(width, height);
          onCanvasReady?.(p);
        };

        p.draw = () => {
          // Animation loop with performance optimization
        };

        p.mousePressed = () => {
          // Mouse interaction with proper event handling
        };
      };

      p5Instance.current = new p5(sketch, canvasRef.current);
    }

    return () => {
      if (p5Instance.current) {
        p5Instance.current.remove();
        p5Instance.current = null;
      }
    };
  }, [width, height, onCanvasReady]);

  return <div ref={canvasRef} />;
};

export default CanvasComponent;
```

### Effect Module Implementation Pattern
```typescript
// Effect module implementation
export const effectModule = {
  setup: (p: p5) => {
    // Initialization logic with proper setup
  },
  
  draw: (p: p5) => {
    // Animation logic with performance optimization
  },
  
  cleanup: () => {
    // Cleanup logic with proper resource management
  }
};
```

## üß™ Testing Implementation

### Component Testing
```typescript
// Component test implementation
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { ComponentName } from './ComponentName';

describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<ComponentName prop1="value" />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Expected Text')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('handles user interactions', () => {
    // Test user interactions and state changes
  });

  it('meets accessibility requirements', () => {
    // Test accessibility compliance
  });
});
```

### Hook Testing
```typescript
// Hook test implementation
import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react';
import { useCustomHook } from './useCustomHook';

describe('useCustomHook', () => {
  it('initializes with correct default values', () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCustomHook());
    expect(result.current.value).toBe(expectedValue);
  });

  it('updates state correctly', () => {
    // Test state updates and side effects
  });
});
```
