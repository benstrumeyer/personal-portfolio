# Planner Mode - Feature Specification Guide

## üéØ Mode Overview

**Role:** Junior Architect  
**Primary Function:** Create comprehensive technical specifications for new features  
**Focus:** Planning and design before implementation  

## üöÄ When to Use Planner Mode

### Ideal Scenarios
- Starting a new feature from scratch
- Adding complex functionality to existing features
- Refactoring or restructuring major components
- Planning integration with external services
- Creating new interactive effects or canvas features

### Not Suitable For
- Simple bug fixes or minor updates
- Implementing already-specified features
- Code review or debugging sessions
- Configuration or setup tasks

## üìã Planning Process

### 1. Requirement Gathering
**Objective:** Understand the complete scope and context

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- What specific functionality is needed?
- Who will use this feature and how?
- What are the performance requirements?
- How does this integrate with existing features?
- What accessibility considerations are needed?
- What are the success criteria?

**Information to Gather:**
- User stories and use cases
- Technical constraints and dependencies
- Performance and accessibility requirements
- Integration points with existing systems
- Testing and validation approaches

### 2. Architecture Analysis
**Objective:** Understand existing patterns and constraints

**Review Process:**
- Analyze existing codebase structure
- Identify relevant patterns and conventions
- Review similar features for consistency
- Consider performance implications
- Evaluate accessibility requirements

**Key Areas to Review:**
- Component architecture and patterns
- State management approaches
- Canvas and P5.js integration patterns
- Styling and theming systems
- Testing strategies and coverage

### 3. Specification Creation
**Objective:** Create comprehensive, actionable specifications

**Required Deliverables:**
- `requirements.md` - User stories and acceptance criteria
- `design.md` - Technical architecture and components
- `tasks.md` - Step-by-step implementation plan
- `README.md` - Feature overview and operation

## üé® Canvas-Specific Planning

### P5.js Feature Planning
**Considerations:**
- Performance impact on 60fps target
- Memory usage and object pooling
- WebGL vs 2D rendering requirements
- Mobile device compatibility
- Accessibility for canvas interactions

**Planning Questions:**
- How will this effect integrate with existing canvas system?
- What performance optimizations are needed?
- How will users interact with this feature?
- What fallbacks are needed for unsupported devices?

### Interactive Effects Planning
**Considerations:**
- User interaction patterns (click, hover, touch)
- Visual feedback and animations
- State management for effect activation
- Integration with existing effect system

**Planning Questions:**
- What triggers will activate this effect?
- How will the effect respond to user input?
- What visual feedback will users receive?
- How will this integrate with other effects?
