## 🚀 How to Use These Guidelines

### For Every Chat Session

**Always attach these 3 files:**
1. `project-context.md` - Complete project overview
2. `ai-behavior-guide.md` - How AI should behave
3. `development-workflow.md` - Development process

**Plus mode-specific files based on your task:**
- **Planning:** `modes/planner-mode.md`
- **Implementation:** `modes/executor-mode.md`
- **AI Configuration:** `modes/steering-architect-mode.md`

### Quick Start Prompts

**Planner Mode:**
```
I'm in Planner mode. Let's specify a new feature: "[feature description]"
Please review the attached steering guidelines and help me create comprehensive specifications.
```

**Executor Mode:**
```
I'm in Executor mode. Go and execute the tasks in `docs/features/[feature-name]/tasks.md`
Please review the attached steering guidelines and implement the approved specifications.
```

**Steering Architect Mode:**
```
I'm in Steering Architect mode. Create the steering files for this project.
Please review the attached steering guidelines and create comprehensive AI rules.
```
