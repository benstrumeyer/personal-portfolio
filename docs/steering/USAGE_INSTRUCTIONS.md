### Steering Architect Mode
**Use when:** Setting up or updating AI rules

**Prompt:**
```
I'm in Steering Architect mode. Create the steering files for this project.

Please review the attached steering guidelines and create comprehensive AI rules that ensure consistent, high-quality assistance.
```

**Attach files:**
- `project-context.md`
- `ai-behavior-guide.md`
- `modes/steering-architect-mode.md`
- `templates/ai-rules-template.md`

## ðŸ“Š Quality Assurance

### Before Starting
- [ ] Confirm AI understands project context
- [ ] Verify mode selection is appropriate
- [ ] Ensure all relevant files are attached
- [ ] Check that requirements are clear

### During Development
- [ ] Request progress updates regularly
- [ ] Ask for code review and quality checks
- [ ] Verify adherence to established patterns
- [ ] Ensure testing requirements are met

### After Completion
- [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Check code quality and standards compliance
- [ ] Ensure documentation is updated
- [ ] Validate performance and accessibility requirements

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI doesn't understand project context:**
- Re-attach `project-context.md`
- Explicitly reference project patterns
- Ask AI to confirm understanding

**AI not following established patterns:**
- Attach `technical/technical-standards.md`
- Reference existing code examples
- Ask for pattern compliance

**AI providing generic advice:**
